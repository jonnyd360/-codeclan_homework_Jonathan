# MVP

This is a mini homework for people doing the PDA. You are going to continue working on your week 2 weekend homework.

We want you to use the skills you have learnt this week to visualise your meteorite data. We do not need anything fancy - just a simple plot that illustrates part of your cleaned data. Please also write up a short description/interpretation of what the plot is showing.

# PDA-specific Requirements

## Outcomes covered

From Programming for Data (J4YB 35):

*3. Write functions and programs to perform data analysis*

- **3.6 Writing function/program to create visualisations**
