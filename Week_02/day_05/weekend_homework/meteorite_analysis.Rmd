Loading the Cleaned data in to R
```{r}
meteorite_clean
```

The names and years found for the 10 largest meteorites in the Data set.

```{r}
meteorite_clean %>% 
  select(name, year, mass_g) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mass_g)) %>% 
  head(10)

```

The average mass of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those which were just found.

```{r}
avg_mass_fell <- meteorite_clean %>% 
  filter(fall == "Fell") %>% 
  summarise(mean(mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  pull()


avg_mass_found <- meteorite_clean %>% 
  filter(fall == "Found") %>% 
  summarise(mean(mass_g, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  pull()

list ("avg_mass_fell" = avg_mass_fell, "avg_mass_found" = avg_mass_found)

```

The number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000.
```{r}
meteorite_clean %>% 
  filter(year >= 2000) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(numer_of_meteorite = n())


```
